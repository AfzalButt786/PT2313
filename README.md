A simple library to drive Audio Chip PT2313L or E
This is a simple library to drive Princeton Technology Corp. chip PT2313, a stereo audio chip with 3 stereo input and loudness,volume,bass,treble and 2 stereo outs.
The library let you access all features by using I2C protocol with Arduino o Teensy 2, 3 ,3.1 processors. This chip works only at 100Khz so don't try to force it at 400 or it will not work.
I've done this to create a stereo amped speakers I had at home.

For connections, refer to datasheet included in docs folder. Have fun!
